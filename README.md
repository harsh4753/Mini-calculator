# Mini-calculator
This C program provides an arbitrary precision calculator, similar to the bc command in Unix-like systems, designed specifically for use in the terminal. It allows you to perform mathematical operations on numbers with very high precision, making it suitable for tasks where standard floating-point arithmetic may lead to precision loss.
