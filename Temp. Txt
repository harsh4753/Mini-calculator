WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE?

The ability to learn and perform suitable techniques to solve problems and achieve goals, appropriate to the context in an uncertain, ever-varying world.

DEFINITION OF AI

➤Artificial Intelligence (AI), a term coined by emeritus Stanford Professor John McCarthy in 1955, was defined by him as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines".

➤ Much research has humans program machines to behave in a clever way, like playing chess, but, today, we emphasize machines that can learn, at least somewhat like human beings do.


➤Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the general term for being able to make computers do things that require intelligence if done by humans.

➤Machine Learning (ML) makes computers learn from data and experience to improve their performance on some tasks or decision-making processes.

➤ Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to deliver state-of-the-art accuracy in object detection, speech recognition and language translation.
